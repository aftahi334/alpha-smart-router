# Validated Foundations â€“ v0.1.0

## Memory Safety & Real-Time Primitives
- **SpscQueue<T>**
    - Lock-free, bounded behavior.
    - Tested with trivially copyable + move-only objects.
    - Verified ownership semantics (no leaks, no aliasing).
    - Real-time suitability: no unbounded allocations during operation.

- **PacketPool**
    - Preallocated, recycled packet buffers.
    - Valid handle lifecycle: no double-free, no dangling handles.
    - Avoids heap fragmentation by using fixed-size memory pool.

## Concurrency & Registry
- **ServiceRegistry**
    - RCU semantics validated: readers always see consistent snapshots.
    - Heterogeneous lookup tested (string IDs, hashes).
    - Thread-safe add/remove operations under concurrent loads.

## Performance Baseline
- **spec_bench**
    - Round-trip throughput measured for `push+pop`.
    - Covers both trivially copyable and move-only objects.
    - Provides initial performance baseline for data-plane components.
